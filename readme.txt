This is the 4155 capstone project github for Course Review Collective.

*ALWAYS start any new development by pulling down any changes from main branch onto your local branch*

To set up app:
- open two separate terminals inside your code editor, in the first terminal run 'cd api' to move to api folder
- in the second terminal, run 'cd client' to move to client folder
- run 'npm install' on the api folder to install all dependencies
- run 'npm install' on the client folder to install dependencies

To start App:
- Starting with the first terminal, run the command 'npm start', to start up the api.
- In the second terminal, run the command 'npm start', to start up the client.
- I find it helpful to have api open in one window completely, and client in a separate window.
- Finally, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
