This is the 4155 capstone project github for Course Review Collective.

*ALWAYS start any new development by pulling down any changes from main branch onto your local branch*

To set up app:
- run 'npm install' on both client and api side, to install all dependencies 

To start App:
- Set up two terminals, one inside api (backend) and one inside client (frontend).
- On both terminals, do the command 'npm start', to start up both sides. 
- I find it helpful to have api open in one window completely, and client in a separate window.
- Finally, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
